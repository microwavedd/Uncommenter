# Uncommenter
An npm package that removes every comment from any given script, no matter the language.


IT IS A CLI (Command Line Interface), and uses the "uc" command.

For instance, to use, you must go to tha directory in which files's comments you want to delete and do either "uc file.extension" or "uc ." the first one will delete the comments of given file, and depending on the extension (Python, C++...) will remove one or another kind of comments (#, //...). Using "." after uc means deleting the comments from EVERY script from the current directory.

AFTER DOWNLOADING, in the root directory you must do "npm link", and you can use it wherever you want to! Easy as that.
